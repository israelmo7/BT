# Gusb [BT]
by Using Btferret project.
-----------------------------
* Connecting to BT device [btlib]
* Setting the Payload
* Sending
* Real-Time sender
-----------------------------
This project monitors and sends on a realTime packets to an endpoint.
the endpoint is a Arduino leo that connected to knowen device that interpreter the packets into HID commands to control the screen via Mouse and Keyboard signals.
for an example - by choosing real time option and using common payload, its possible to control the endpoint device with movements/HID data and fix it on RT so it will make the perfect specific payload for doing some action, and afterword it will be possible to do actions on same endpoints with one click.
